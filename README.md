# ChatGPT Reviews Analysis Using Python

## Project Overview

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of ChatGPT reviews to extract meaningful insights and identify trends. The analysis encompasses Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), sentiment analysis, trend analysis, and evaluation of app performance across different versions. Various visualizations and seasonal decomposition techniques are used to provide a detailed understanding of user experiences and application performance.

## Objectives

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understand the distribution of reviews, ratings, and other features.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Gauge the sentiment of reviews and identify patterns based on sentiment.
- **Trend Analysis:** Examine trends over time, including the number of reviews and rating changes.
- **App Version Analysis:** Evaluate how different versions of the app affect user ratings and reviews.
- **Visualizations:** Create visual representations to make the data more interpretable.
- **Seasonal Decomposition:** Analyze seasonal patterns and trends in review volumes.

## Data

The dataset includes the following columns:
- `Name`: Reviewer's name
- `Rating`: User rating
- `Comment`: Review text
- `Date`: Date of the review
- `Country`: Reviewer's country
- `Thumbs Up`: Number of thumbs up received
- `Review ID`: Unique identifier for each review
- `App Version`: Version of the app used
